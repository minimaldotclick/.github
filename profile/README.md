# minimal.click

Created to explore code, tools, products and services using sustainable and ethical business practices through the utilisation of open source tools and methodologies.

This means that minimal.click is my small creative studio that concentrates on creating minimal music, art, games and writing using open source and foss technologies with the plan that this will be able to offset my cost of living and I can be a production house of one.
